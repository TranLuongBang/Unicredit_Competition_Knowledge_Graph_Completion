###  UniCredit Training Camp Kaggle Competition!

**Knowledge Graph Completion**

A Knowledge Graph is a powerful semantic model to represent complex relations between real-world entities such as news, people. Thanks to they ability of modeling large-scale data from a vast amount of heterogeneous sources, knowledge graphs are nowadays the model of choice for many different application domains that have to deal with the challenge of extracting and structuring knowledge on millions of entities and relations.
Modern enterprise knowledge graphs are built by ingesting vast amounts of data.


However, despite these efforts, many entities and relations are not properly captured in the resulting model. In order to complete such missing information, the task of Knowledge Graph Completion has been studied by researchers and practitioners.
The aim of this camp is to overview the main state-of-the-art techniques for the tasks of link prediction and knowledge graph completion. More specifically:

* Link prediction using Machine Learning

* Knowledge graph embedding

* Rule mining for knowledge graph

Specifically, the competition consists in predicting whether a given knowledge-graph triple is true or false.
